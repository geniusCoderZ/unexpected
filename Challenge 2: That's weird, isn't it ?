You enjoyed your first week in you high school or university. You mingled with new friends and had a fun time.
But something was bothering you. You feel you're being watched. 
Everywhere you go, you find the same student staring at you in an uncomfortable way. 
Trying to ignore the fact didn't help of course.
One day after classes and after playing basketball with mates, you went to the washroom to wash your hands. 
A man wearing sunglasses showed up and said something strange:
- "So you're back. We didn't expect that." 
Just before turning around to recognise him, he disappeared. 
He left a piece of paper on which he wrote a URL of a file stored in the cloud. 
You went home, downloaded the file, and, to your surprise, 
found the complete list of all the students who applied to your university !
Full names, age (by interval), email addresses, residency...

You were very confused and wondered why you're  being followed and why you're given such file. 
After a closer look, you realized that everyone had an 8-digit key. 
You thought the man was trying to tell you something through those keys. 
Therefore, you wrote a software to find your key, just in case you need it.

For example:
Let Alan Lucas be a someone who lives in New York, is 22 years old and has a key of 46127548.
This can be written as the following:
Alan Lucas,New York,alanlucas13@uni.edu,19-22,46127548
Alan Lucas,New York,alanlucas13@uni.edu,20-23,46127548
Alan Lucas,New York,alanlucas13@uni.edu,20-22,46127548
Alan Lucas,New York,alanlucas13@uni.edu,22-24,46127548
..... and so on......
