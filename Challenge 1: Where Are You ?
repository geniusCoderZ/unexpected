The next day would be your first day of high school/university. 
To avoid getting lost, you opened an online map that showed local stores and institutions. 
Sadly, the city was too crowded and many buildings had similar names. 
So you extracted the GPS information of each facility to a file called "Dataset.txt"
and wrote a software to find your high school/university. 
Each line contains the names of the buildings on the same street that are away from one another by 25m.
For example:
  Pacha NYC,Western Connecticut State University,Bank of New Jersey,Morris Public Library
You can visualize that as follows:
           25m                                         25m                       25m
Pacha NYC <----> Western Connecticut State University <----> Bank of New Jersey <----> Morris Public Library

What you know: Your school is distant from "Panda King" by 75m.
