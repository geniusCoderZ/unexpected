# A simple story-based programming contest:
You are a talented student who wants to survive high school or university. Your skills in programming and problem solving will help you do just that. I designed daily challenges to enhance your thought process and to build a practical experience in the C++ programming language. The contest will last 2-3 weeks so there is enough time for you to learn C++ and to solve the problems (in order). I'm expecting you to put up the effort and to spare some time for that. Take this opportunity and you will be happy for doing so. Good luck !

# Why am I doing this ?
1. Following YouTube tutorials will lead you nowhere unless you actually start writing useful code.
2. Competitive programming contests are super boring and will teach you nothing apart from bad habits such as trusting the user input.
3. Beginner-friendly programming ideas available online are too simplistic. They won't teach you how to solve real world problems.

Please note that I only express my opinion and I'm not trying to offend anyone. Thank you for being understanding.

# Why is it free ?
Many yougsters simply cannot afford expensive bootcamps and story-based programming contests are next to non-existent. Therefore, I decided to take the initiative. I hope you enjoy the contest.

# Why C++ ?
1. Unlike other high level programming languages such as *coughs* Python, C++ is super duper crazy fast and efficient. Bear in mind that C++ is a HUGE beast. Hence, I advise you learn C first because it's MUCH simpler. This can be done in a week or two just to get started and be able to participate in the contest.
2. Working with C will teach you how computers really work. Once you acquire some of that knowledge, you will build C++ programs to find the answers of the 6 problems. This is because working with strings in C is very challenging. If you can do it, good for you ! 
3. C++ is useful for many applications. Do some research to find out why.
