In a group work, you were asked to write a script for a speech about C++. 
You gathered some information online and were left with an unformatted file. 
Given that you have just lost your phone and don't want to spend too much time fine tuning the text, 
you decided to write a software to get the job done for you.

What you know: The text needs to be formatted
What you have: Download "wiki.txt"
Your Target: Format the text as following:

1. The letters after full stops and names must be capitalized. Otherwise, they must be lowered.
For example: 
  The bird EATS cheese. the Fox is jealous.
This sentence should be converted to the following:
The bird eats cheese. The fox is jealous.
HINT: If a an entire word is found capitalized, it's probably a name and should remain unchanged.

2. Numbers between brackets should be deleted.
For example: It's well-known that [3] C++ is efficient.
This sentence should be converted to the following:
It's well-known that C++ is efficient.

3. Double spaces should be converted to a single space.

Consider only making these changes.
