Lectures seem to last for ages, if you ask me. Luckily for you, it's finally the weekend. 
Everybody was at home studying, but of course, unlike the others, you decided to go on a walk, a long one...
When coming back home, you realized that... your phone was stolen !! 
You have just been a victim of pickpocketing despite all your security measures. 

Instead of blaming yourself for going out, you opened your laptop to ask friends for help 
and to look for useful information online. 
During your research, Facebook sent you a notification to remind you of 88 upcoming events. 
Suddenly, you remembered that you signed up for a programming contest that you absolutely didn't want to miss. 
To make things worse, you forgot its name and location.
For example:
  Coding Gram / 19:30 / 2 / Exodus Development Co.
This means that an event of name "Coding Gram" starts at 19:30, lasts for 2 hours and is hosted by Exodus Development Co.

What you know: The event ends at 21:45.
